<p>I enjoy tasting different things because I'm a foodie. I had the chance to eat both Mexican and Chinese food, and I truly liked both of them. I really enjoyed.</p>

<p>Mutton curry with vada is a crazy combination. The crispiness of the vada and spice of the mutton makes me mad.so i love this combination.</p>
